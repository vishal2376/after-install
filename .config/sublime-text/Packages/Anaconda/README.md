# VERY IMPORTANT NOTICE, PLEASE, READ CAREFULLY

**New versions of this plugin only works with Python >= 3.6 and requires Sublime Text 4 build >= 4107**

This means versions higher than 2.2.3 **will not** work in Sublime Text 3 

## For Sublime Text 3 Users

If for whatever reason you can not - you do not want to upgrade to Sublime Text 4, remove Anaconda from your setup using Package Control, download [v2.2.3](https://github.com/DamnWidget/anaconda/releases/tag/v2.2.3), unpack it in your Users package directory and never ever try to install it through package control

## Alternatives

The plugins ecosystem in Sublime Text have improved by a lot in the past few years, there are many alternatives to anaconda that might work better for you 

**Python**: Give a try to [LSP-pyright](https://github.com/sublimelsp/LSP-pyright) it works pretty well afaik   
**Go**: More LSP plugins [LSP-gopls](https://github.com/sublimelsp/LSP-gopls) works well and uses the official gopls server   
**Rust**: Same for Rust [LSP-rust-analyzer](https://github.com/sublimelsp/LSP-rust-analyzer) it is pretty ussable it needs a bit of tuning but it works well   

For all of these ^^ you need to install [LSP](https://github.com/sublimelsp/LSP)

## Tooltips
anaconda officially supports user themeable tooltips and displaying advanced signatures. This is how it looks in a dark theme:

![Tooltips Image][tooltips-dark-image]

**Note**: This feature is enabled for users of Sublime Text 3 build 3070 or superior only.

## Troubleshooting
This section lists some common issues faced by users, along with workarounds.

#### Anaconda does not appear in the Available Packages list on Package Control.

**Work-around**: You have to update your Package Control version to the version 2.0 or better.

#### Errors in the console about "the file can't be open" in worker.py file.
Your Sublime Text can't find the interpreter that you set in your configuration, by default, anaconda sets this as `python` so it will get your configured Python interpreter in your PATH (if any).

**Work-around**: Add a Python interpreter (named `python`) to your PATH or set a right full path to your python interpreter as parameter of `python_interpreter` settings option, for example `/usr/local/bin/python3.4`.

#### Auto-complete for import behaves badly.
Sublime Text 3's default Python package cancels the auto-completion when some words are detected (for example `def` or `class`). This list of words includes `import`.

**Work-around**: Create a new Python directory in your Packages directory and copy the contents of the file [Completion Rules.tmPreferences][Completion-Rules] there with the same name.
Delete your Sublime Text Cache file `Cache/Python/Completion Rules.tmPreferences.cache`.

**NOTE**: The cache path can be obtained from the Sublime TExt 3 console using the code `sublime.cache_path()`

#### Auto-complete drop-down shows up incorrectly.
SublimeCodeIntel interferes with anaconda's auto-completion.

**Work-around**: Consider disabling SublimeCodeIntel for Python views or disabling/removing it completely when using anaconda.

#### Anaconda behaves slowly and jsonserver crashes
If you are in POSIX systems (Linux or OS X) take a look at the owner of the anaconda's jsonserver log files, they *must* be owned by your user or the jsonserver would be unable to start up. Log files can be found in:
* GNU/Linux: ~/.local/share/anaconda/logs
* OS X: ~/Library/Logs/anaconda
* Windows: %APPDATA%\\Anaconda\\Logs

### Available plugins for Anaconda
Anaconda is a plugable architecture platform itself, it means that anaconda can be extended to offer rich IDE like features to other languages, I created other extensions that brings
anaconda capabilities to other languages, the complete list of them can be shown below

| Language | Web Site | Package Control | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Go** | https://github.com/DamnWidget/anaconda_go | Yes | Unmaintained |
| **Rust** | https://github.com/DamnWidget/anaconda_rust | Yes | Unmaintained |
| **PHP** | https://github.com/DamnWidget/anaconda_php | Yes | Unmaintained |

Would you like to see your language empowered by anaconda? Use `anaconda_rust` or `anaconda_php` as templates and bring your language to life with anaconda's plugable architecture.
