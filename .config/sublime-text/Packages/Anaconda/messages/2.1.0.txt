Anaconda v2.1.0
===============

Welcome to new anaconda v2.1.0, what do you can find in this new release?

## Reverts

  - Reverted fix for #535 as it produced lot of errors when a blank line was
    found in the top of the file

## Fixes

  - Fixed typo in error message
  - Anaconda was not able to correctly lint undefined variables when the
    word 'global' was found in the buffer, this is now fixed

## Updates

  - Updated PyFlakes to version 1.3.0

## Additions

  - Added new ExplorerPanel class that is being used by Find Usages, Goto
    and Goto Python Object commands, this new panel is way better than the
    now deprecated 'JediUsages' as it supports nesting, go back and other
    features

## Improvements

  - Now the JsonServer is resilent to handlers (and plugin handlers) crashes
  - The linter system has been updated with a new configuration option that
    improves the linting of static file only analysis linters (this is widely
    required by anaconda_rust and anaconda_go plugins)

## Deprecations

  - Now `anaconda.anaconda_lib.jediusages.JediUsages` is deprecated plugins
    should not be using it anymore in favor of the new `ExplorerPanel`,
    `JediUsages` is marked as deprectaed and will be removed ini future
    releases of anaconda.
