Anaconda v2.0.8
===============

This is a minor bug fix and features release

## Fixes

	- Fixed line truncation in some PEP8 errors descriptions related with bad
	  indentation
    - Fixed anaconda failing to determine the next error when running Next
      error comman

## Additions

	- Added new `Previous lint error` command that works opposite to the
	  already present `Next lint error` (obviusly)
	- Added new config option `swallog_startup_errors` to completely
	  ignore startup errors (use at your own risk)
