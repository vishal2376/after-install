The whole work seen here was originally a fork of another repository:
[ClangAutoComplete](https://github.com/pl-ca/ClangAutoComplete)

However, with time this plugin has grown quite different from its origin and
this is why you see it as a separate package now. Anyway, feel free to check
out what `ClangAutoComplete` has to offer and come back if you still like this
plugin more.

The trick with multiple `clang.cindex` files is inspired by this repo:
[clangHelper](https://github.com/griebd/clangHelper). Thanks for inspiration!

The progress indicator idea is from
[ColorSublime](https://github.com/Colorsublime/Colorsublime-Plugin) plugin.

Some functionality is there only because of the awesome contributors to this
project. To see their names plese check out the contributors page.
