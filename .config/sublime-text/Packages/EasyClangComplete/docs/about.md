# About me

![My pic](img/my_photo.jpg) 

I started this plugin as a PhD student at the University of Bonn, doing
Robotics, Computer Vision and Photogrammetry. I wrote this plugin because
of my obsession with Sublime Text and the need (and will) to code in C++ every
day. At the start of this journey there was no plugin that would suit my needs *exactly* and as a result you see this plugin here today.
