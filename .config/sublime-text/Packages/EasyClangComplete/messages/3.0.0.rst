Version 3.0.0
=============

New features:
-------------

- add support for `-isysroot` flag for OSX, fix `-isystem` flag.
- allow wider error popup windows
- open plugin settings side-by-side just like sublime does with its settings
- flags order is now preserved, so the flags are passed to clang in the same
  order as they appear in settings and/or .clang_complete file
- fix the completions being shown in a wrong location after a long completion
  request has finished while the cursor was moved
- Following settings not used anymore or updated:
  + `cmake_flags_priority`
  + `generate_flags_with_cmake`
  + `search_clang_complete_file`
  + `max_tu_age` changed to `max_cache_age`
- `.clang_complete` file will not get generated by the plugin anymore. Instead,
  the flags are loaded directly from their source file, e.g. `CMakeLists.txt`,
  `compile_commands.json` or user-defined `.clang_complete`.
- New setting introduced:
  + `flags_sources` to allow specifying where the plugin will try to get flags
    for compilation from.
- When using `libclang` the plugin now filters private members, destructors,
  constructors and enums when needed. Thanks @simia for contribution.
