=============

Generate compilation database with Bazel!
-----------------------------------------
There is a new option available for everyone using Bazel on Linux and OSX.
It is still experimental, but seems to be working.

If you have a Bazel project, open any file in it and call the command:
"ECC: (Bazel) Generate compile_commands.json"

This will use https://github.com/grailbio/bazel-compilation-database
It generates a compilation database and if it fails it shows the error
in an output panel. The approximate sequence of actions is as follows:

- Search for a folder with a WORKSPACE file up the tree.
- Run a script "generate.sh" from the repo in that folder.
- If the command fails, show the output.

üëèüßº Stay safe!
---------------
Hope everyone is staying safe in these weird times! This is a good time to
stay at home and delve into that side-project you've been postponing for ages!
