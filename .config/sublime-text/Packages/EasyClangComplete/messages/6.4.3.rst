Version 6.4.3
=============

Improvements and bug fixes:
---------------------------
- More powerful cmake-related flags parsing. If you ever wanted to use flags
  like `-DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=~/some_path/*`, now you can!
  See [1] for details.
- **WARNING**: the sub-setting of the `CMakeLists.txt` entry `prefix_paths`
  is now deprecated as all the functionality is covered by the more useful
  `flags` sub-setting. You can still use it for now, but I will remove it
  in the future.
- Fixed a jump to a wrong location when going to declaration, thanks @berteauxjb
- Fixed typo in the message below, thanks @berkus
