Version 6.5.0
=============

Improvements and bug fixes:
---------------------------
- New include autocompletion!
  - New setting "autocomplete_includes" defaulted to true, so make
    sure to reload sublime text!
  - Press `<` or `"` after `#include` to open quick panel with guided
    completion for your includes. The initial list is populated from
    the current translation unit (make sure the initial parsing is
    complete!) while the next layers stem from chosen folders. In the
    end, the picked file is committed to file.
  - Details here:
    https://niosus.github.io/EasyClangComplete/settings/#autocomplete_includes
- Info popup now also shows references from open files.
- Get rid of a singleton in the thread pool. Use a single instance per
  plugin.
