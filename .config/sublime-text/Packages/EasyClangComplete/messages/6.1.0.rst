Version 6.1.0
=============

Breaking changes:
-----------------
The compilation database is now parsed differently by default:
  + All entries are parsed in a lazy fashion by default.
  + This allows to load huge databases relatively quickly.
  + There is no more "all" entry added to the database.
  + If the file is not in the database and no mapping to an existing file found
    through "header_to_source_mapping" setting there will be no flags emmitted
    for this file.
  + To return old behavior, set "lazy_flag_parsing" setting to "false".

Other changes:
--------------
- Resolve symlinks for file locations in info popup.
- Resolve symlinks for files from compilation flags sources.
- Show column and row when showing index.
