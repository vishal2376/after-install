Version 6.0.2
=============

Bug fixes:
----------
- Fix -cxx-isystem flag not parsed correctly.
- Fix error with new list search scope.
- Thanks to @mjendruk the wildcard "$project_base_path" will **not** be
  deprecated. Please ignore the message in version 6.0.0 release.
  "$project_base_path" has a different meaning than "$project_path". Both will
  be available for use.
