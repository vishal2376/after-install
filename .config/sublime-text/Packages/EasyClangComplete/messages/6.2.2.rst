Version 6.2.2
=============

Improvements and bug fixes:
---------------------------
- Strip "(framework directory)" for macOS builds, thanks @saagarjha
- Disambiguate warnings from errors by the gutter icon
- Disable loading default definitions from a compiler by default as it seems
  to cause quite a bit of problems. To restore the behavior just enable:
  "use_default_definitions": true
